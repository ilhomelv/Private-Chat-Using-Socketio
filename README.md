Simple chat aplication using socketio and nodeJS with no user interface
(my whole purpose was learning how to using socketio and get acquainted with nodeJS)

To private msg someone who is online do "@"username Your message and
 it will be sent private to user with username 
if there exist no username will show you an error.
(Quotes for clarity)
The user to whom you messaged privately will see a message in green color.

```
#!python


To run this Clone it into your local machine.

Download NodeJS from their website(If you dont have)
And open nodeJS command prompt(If you are on windows ) and 
change directory to your cloned folder.
and run
**npm install** 
to install all dependencies in one go and finally type 
**node app.js** 
and head over to **localhost:3000** to see application running
```


Thanks.
